# Ultimate Randomizer - Minecraft randomizer plugin

## Challenge yourself or your friends to beat the Ender Dragon with Ultimate Randomizer! Ultimate Randomizer is a simple yet highly configurable Minecraft plugin that randomizes block and Mob drops.



## Features
- every block drops a new random item. Some blocks could drop the same item, while others could drop nothing. The dropped amount can be configured in the config
- mobs drop random items as well! The drop chance stays the same and mobs that normally drop multiple items will still do that
- mobs drop a random amount of experience, also configurable in the config
- a timer starts when you use /randomizer start. This can be disabled in the config (enabled by default)

## Commands
| Command               | Permission             | Description            |
|:---------------------:|:----------------------:|:----------------------:|
| /randomizer **start** | `randomizer.randomizer`| enables the randomizer |
